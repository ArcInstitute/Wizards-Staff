    "- Gathering the necessary files for the analysis via `categorize_files`, which organizes the results from the Lizard-Wizard pipeline into a structured format for analysis.\n",
    "- Looping through each file in the categorized results and loading the required data using `load_required_files`.\n",
    "- Applying spatial filtering to remove noise in the calcium imaging data using `spatial_filtering`. This step filters the regions of interest (ROIs) based on the image data and thresholds defined, ensuring that only relevant signal areas are processed.\n",
    "- Loading the ΔF/F₀ data, which represents fluorescence changes relative to baseline levels, and converting it to calcium signals and spike events using the `convert_f_to_cs` function.\n",
    "- Z-scoring the spike events with `zscore` to normalize them, making the data easier to compare and threshold for event detection.\n",
    "- Filtering the calcium signals and spike events based on the indexing results of `spatial_filtering`.\n",
    "- Calculating the intended metric which in this case is Firing Rate Per Minute (FRPM) for each neuron using the `calc_frpm` function, which analyzes the z-scored spike events to compute firing rates based on the specified z-score threshold.\n",
    "- Storing the FRPM data in a list, which is later converted to a pandas DataFrame for further analysis or visualization.\n",
